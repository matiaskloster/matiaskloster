Hi! I'm Matias. I'm currently working in Application Support and actively transitioning into roles focused on **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** and **QA Automation**.

This repository showcases exercises, scripts, and personal projects where I apply tools and concepts from the DevOps, SRE, and testing world:

- 🐍 Python scripting for automation and testing
- 📊 Service monitoring using tools like New Relic, logs, and custom scripts
- 🔍 Log analysis with Graylog, regex, and log parsers
- ✅ Automated testing (unit, integration, mocking, TDD)
- ☁️ Working with AWS and REST APIs using Python
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC - upcoming)

---

## Purpose 🎯

This portfolio documents my hands-on progress as I build skills in:

- Python scripting for real-world SRE and QA use cases
- DevOps culture: observability, reliability, automation
- CI/CD, alerting, performance, and error handling
- Best practices in test automation and documentation

---

## In Progress 🚧

This is a living portfolio. I’m continuously adding new projects and exercises as I advance my learning path.
